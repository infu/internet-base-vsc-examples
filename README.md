# Internet Base

Search & install the 'Internet Base' VS Code extensions, so you can open .blast files.

## Running in dev container

Search & install the 'Dev Containers' extension.

From the left panel choose 'Remote Explorer'

Then click 'Open Folder in Container' and 'Open'. It may take a while the first time you do that.

You are in a container made by us which has everything you need to develop on the Internet Computer. Its files are inside `.devcontainer`

It also installs Blast Node Kernel so you can run .blast files inside it. Not using that Kernel while using readFile and readDir will result in errors.
